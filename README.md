# Bio2RDF2Schema.org

We use SPARQL construct to map Bio2RDF terms to Schema.org terms -> we convert the resulting RDF graph to JSON-LD format and embed these in HTML files which we intend to publish for indexing by Google.

We have started with mapping [Drugbank](http://www.drugbank.ca/) data in this fashion.
