  "alternateName" : "Erythropoietin precursor",
  "description" : "Human erythropoietin (recombinant), produced by CHO cells.",
  "doseSchedule" : "2000 [iU]/mL Injection, solution form with intravenous; subcutaneous route",
  "legalStatus" : "approved",
  "mechanismOfAction" : "Binding of erythropoietin to the erythropoietin receptor leads to receptor dimerization, which facilitates activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathways within the cytosol. Activated STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) proteins are then translocated to the nucleus where they serve as transcription factors which regulate the activation of specific genes involved in cell division or differentiation.",
