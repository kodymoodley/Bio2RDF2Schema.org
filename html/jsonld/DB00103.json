  "clinicalPharmacology" : "Used in the treatment of Fabry disease, an X-linked genetic disorder of glycosphingolipid metabolism. The disease is characterized by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A, which leads to progressive accumulation of glycosphingolipids, predominantly GL-3, in many body tissues. Clinical manifestations of Fabry disease include renal failure, cardiomyopathy, and cerebrovascular accidents. Fabrazyme is intended to provide an exogenous source of alpha-galactosidase A and to limit the accumulation of these glycolipids in the tissues. Studies show unconclusive evidence for the clinical efficacy of either agalasidase alfa or agalasidase beta in preventing morbidity.",
