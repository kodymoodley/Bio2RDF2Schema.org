  "doseSchedule" : "2.2 mg/2mL Injection, powder, lyophilized, for solution form with intravenous route",
  "legalStatus" : "approved",
  "mechanismOfAction" : "Alteplase binds to fibrin rich clots via the fibronectin finger-like domain and the Kringle 2 domain. The protease domain then cleaves the Arg/Val bond in plasminogen to form plasmin. Plasmin in turn degrades the fibrin matrix of the thrombus, thereby exerting its thrombolytic action.",
