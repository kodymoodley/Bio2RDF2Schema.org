  "description" : "Human interferon beta (165 residues), cysteine 17 is substituted with serine. Produced in E. coli, no carbohydrates, MW=18.5kD",
  "doseSchedule" : "Kit form with  route",
  "legalStatus" : "approved",
  "mechanismOfAction" : "Interferon beta binds to type I interferon receptors (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c) which activate two Jak (Janus kinase) tyrosine kinases (Jak1 and Tyk2). These transphosphorylate themselves and phosphorylate the receptors. The phosphorylated INFAR receptors then bind to Stat1 and Stat2 (signal transducers and activators of transcription)which dimerize and activate multiple (~100) immunomodulatory and antiviral proteins. Interferon beta binds more stably to type I interferon receptors than interferon alpha.",
