  "clinicalPharmacology" : "Used in organ transplant prophylaxis, Muromonab or OKT-3 binds specifically to the CD-3 complex, which is involved in antigen recognition and cell stimulation, on the surface of T lymphocytes. Immediately after administration CD-3-positive T lymphocytes are abruptly removed from circulation. It has been effective in reversing corticosteroid-resistant acute rejection in renal, liver, and cardiac transplant recipients.",
