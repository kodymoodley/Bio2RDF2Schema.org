  "description" : "Murine monoclonal antibody specific to CD3 T-cell lymphocyte antigens. More specifically it is a purified murine (mouse) monoclonal antibody, directed against the CD3 (T3) receptor on the surface of human T-cells (T-lymphocytes) cultured using the murine ascites method. Muromonab is 93% monomeric immune globulin G type 2a (IgG2a).",
  "doseSchedule" : "5 mg/5mL Injection, solution form with intravenous route",
  "legalStatus" : "investigational",
  "mechanismOfAction" : "Muromonab binds to the T-cell surface glycoprotein CD3 epsilon chain. It appears to kill CD-3 positive cells by inducing Fc mediated apoptosis, antibody mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity.",
