  "mechanismOfAction" : "Oxiconazole inhibits ergosterol biosynthesis, which is required for cytoplasmic membrane integrity of fungi. It acts to destabilize the fungal cyctochrome P450 51 enzyme (also known as Lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase). This is vital in the cell membrance structure of the fungus. Its inhibition leads to cell lysis. Oxiconazole has also been shown in inhibit DNA synthesis and suppress intracellular concentrations of ATP. Like other imidazole antifungals, Oxiconazole can increase membrane permeability to zinc, augmenting its cytotoxicity.",
