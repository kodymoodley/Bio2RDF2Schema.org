The drug contains both FSH and LH,therefore, it induces ovarian follicular growth and development as well as gonadal steroid production in women who do not have ovarian failure.FSH is the primary driver of follicular recruitment and growth in early folliculogenesis, while LH is important for ovarian steroidogenesis and is involved in the physiological events leading to development of a competent pre-ovulatory follicle",
