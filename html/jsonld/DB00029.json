  "description" : "Human tissue plasminogen activator, purified, glycosylated, 527 residues purified from CHO cells. Eminase is a lyophilized (freeze-dried) formulation of anistreplase, the p-anisoyl derivative of the primary Lys-plasminogen-streptokinase activator complex (a complex of Lys-plasminogen and streptokinase). A p-anisoyl group is chemically conjugated to a complex of bacterial-derived streptokinase and human Plasma-derived Lys-plasminogen proteins.",
