  "clinicalPharmacology" : "Somavert is used for the treatment of acromegaly, which arises from excessive IGF-1 levels. Somavert selectively binds to growth hormone (GH) receptors on cell surfaces, where it blocks the binding of endogenous GH, and thus interferes with GH signal transduction. Inhibition of GH action results in decreased serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3). This reduces the symptoms of acromegaly.",

  "description" : "Pegvisomant is a highly selective growth hormone (GH) receptor antagonist.  It is used to treat acromegaly.  Unlike dopamine or somatostatin analogs (which inhibit growth hormone secretion), this drug actually blocks the hepatic (GH-mediated) production of insulin like growth factor (IGF-1), which is the main mediator of growth hormone activity.",
