  "description" : "Pegvisomant is a highly selective growth hormone (GH) receptor antagonist.  It is used to treat acromegaly.  Unlike dopamine or somatostatin analogs (which inhibit growth hormone secretion), this drug actually blocks the hepatic (GH-mediated) production of insulin like growth factor (IGF-1), which is the main mediator of growth hormone activity.",
  "doseSchedule" : "20 mg Powder for solution form with subcutaneous route",
  "legalStatus" : "approved",
  "manufacturer" : "Pharmacia and upjohn co",
  "mechanismOfAction" : "Somavert selectively binds to growth hormone (GH) receptors on cell surfaces, where it blocks the binding of endogenous GH. This leads to the normalization of serum IGF-1 levels.",
  "name" : "Pegvisomant",
