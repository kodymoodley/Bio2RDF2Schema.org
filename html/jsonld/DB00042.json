  "description" : "Neurotoxin produced by fermentation of clostridium botulinum type B. The protein exists in noncovalent association with hemagglutinin and nonhemagglutinin proteins as a neurotoxin complex. The neurotoxin complex is recovered from the fermentation process and purified through a series of precipitation and chromatography steps.",
  "doseSchedule" : "10000 [USP'U]/2mL Injection, solution form with intramuscular route",
  "legalStatus" : "approved",
  "mechanismOfAction" : "Botulinum Toxin Type B binds to and cleaves the synaptic Vesicle Associated Membrane Protein (VAMP, also known as synaptobrevin) which is a component of the protein complex responsible for docking and fusion of the synaptic vesicle to the presynaptic membrane, a necessary step to neurotransmitter release.",
