  "mechanismOfAction" : "Vision:Vitamin A (all-<i>trans</i> retinol) is converted in the retina to the 11-<i>cis</i>-isomer of retinaldehyde or 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal. 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal functions in the retina in the transduction of light into the neural signals necessary for vision. 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal, while attached to opsin in rhodopsin is isomerized to all-<i>trans</i>-retinal by light. This is the event that triggers the nerve impulse to the brain which allows for the perception of light. All-<i>trans</i>-retinal is then released from opsin and reduced to all-<i>trans</i>-retinol. All-<i>trans</i>-retinol is isomerized to 11-<i>cis</i>-retinol in the dark, and then oxidized to 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal. 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal recombines with opsin to re-form rhodopsin. Night blindness or defective vision at low illumination results from a failure to re-synthesize 11-<i>cis</i> retinal rapidly. <br/>Epithelial differentiation: The role of Vitamin A in epithelial differentiation, as well as in other physiological processes, involves the binding of Vitamin A to two families of nuclear retinoid receptors (retinoic acid receptors, RARs; and retinoid-X receptors, RXRs). These receptors function as ligand-activated transcription factors that modulate gene transcription. When there is not enough Vitamin A to bind these receptors, natural cell differentiation and growth are interrupted.",
