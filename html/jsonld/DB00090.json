  "description" : "Human recombinant alpha-L-iduronidase, 628 residues (mature form), produced by recombinant DNAtechnology in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line. Laronidase is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 83 kD. The predicted amino acid sequence of the recombinant form, as well as the nucleotide sequence that encodes it, are identical to a polymorphic form of human a-L-iduronidase. It contains 6 N-linked oligosaccharide modification sites.",
  "doseSchedule" : "2.9 mg/5mL Injection, solution, concentrate form with intravenous route",
  "legalStatus" : "approved",
  "mechanismOfAction" : "Laronidase catalyses the hydrolysis of terminal alpha-L-iduronic acid residues of dermatan sulfate and heparin sulfate.",
  "name" : "Laronidase",
