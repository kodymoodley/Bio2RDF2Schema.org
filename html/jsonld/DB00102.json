  "description" : "Becaplermin is produced by recombinant DNA technology by insertion of the gene for the B chain of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) into the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Becaplermin has a molecular weight of approximately 25 KD and is a homodimer composed of two identical polypeptide chains that are bound together by disulfide bonds",

  "mechanismOfAction" : "Binds to the beta platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor, a tyrosine kinase receptor. PDGF is known to exist as a dimer, and activates its signaling pathway by a ligand induced receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation. PDGF receptors also contain many auto-phosphorylation sites, which serve to mediate binding of SH2 sites and subsequently signal corresponding pathways. There are five different isoforms of PDGF that activate through two different receptors (alpha and beta).",
