  "clinicalPharmacology" : "Moxifloxacin is a quinolone/fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Moxifloxacin can be used to treat infections caused by the following bacteria: Aerobic Gram-positive microorganisms: <i>Corynebacterium</i> species, <i>Micrococcus luteus</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i>, <i>Staphylococcus haemolyticus</i>, <i>Staphylococcus hominis</i>, <i>Staphylococcus warneri</i>, <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, and <i>Streptococcus viridans</i> group. Aerobic Gram-negative microorganisms: <i>Acinetobacter lwoffii</i>, <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i>, and <i>Haemophilus parainfluenzae</i>. Other microorganisms: <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i>.<br/>Moxifloxacin is bactericidal and its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which allows the untwisting required to replicate one DNA double helix into two. Notably the drug has 100 times higher affinity for bacterial DNA gyrase than for mammalian. Moxifloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.",
