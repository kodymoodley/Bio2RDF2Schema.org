Serotonin has been variously described as a central neurohumoral agent or chemical mediator, as a \"headache substance\" acting directly or indirectly to lower pain threshold, as an intrinsic \"motor hormone\" of the gastrointestinal tract, and as a \"hormone\" involved in connective tissue reparative processes.",

It antagonizes the effects of serotonin in blood vessels and gastrointestinal smooth muscle, but has few of the properties of other ergot alkaloids.
