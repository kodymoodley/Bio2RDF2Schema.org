  "clinicalPharmacology" : "In multiple sclerosis, lesions are believed to occur when activated inflammatory cells, including T-lymphocytes, cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Leukocyte migration across the BBB involves interaction between adhesion molecules on inflammatory cells, and their counter-receptors present on endothelial cells of the vessel wall. The clinical effect of natalizumab in multiple sclerosis may be a secondary result of its blockade of the molecular interaction of a 4b 1-integrin expressed by inflammatory cells with VCAM-1 on vascular endothelial cells, and with CS-1 and/or osteopontin expressed by parenchymal cells in the brain. ?4-integrin is required for white blood cells to move into organs, therefore, natalizumab prevents these immune cells from crossing blood vessel walls to reach affected organs thereby decreasing inflamation.",
