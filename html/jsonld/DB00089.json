  "description" : "Capromab is a Murine IgG1 monoclonal 7E11-C5.3 antibody that recognizes prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA – also known as glutamate carboxypeptidase 2) from prostate cancer cells and normal prostate tissue. It is linked to pendetide, a derivative of DTPA. Pendetide acts as a chelating agent for the radionuclide indium-111. Capromab is used to image the extent of prostate cancer.",
