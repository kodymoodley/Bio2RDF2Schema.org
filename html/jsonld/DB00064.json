  "description" : "A diagnostic radiopharmaceutical containing iodinated I 131 albumin for intravenous imaging. Following intravenous injection, radioiodinated albumin human is uniformly distributed throughout the intravascular pool within 10 minutes; extravascular distribution takes place more slowly (2 days). Indicated for use in determinations of total blood and plasma volumes, cardiac output, cardiac and pulmonary blood volumes and circulation times",
