  "mechanismOfAction" : "Eptifibatide inhibits platelet aggregation by reversibly binding to the platelet receptor glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa of human platelets, thus preventing the binding of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and other adhesive ligands. Inhibition of platelet aggregation occurs in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner.",
