  "clinicalPharmacology" : "Remikiren is an orally available renin inhibitor with an established blood pressure-lowering effect in patients with essential hypertension. No data are available on the renal effects of remikiren in humans. In patients with essential hypertension, a single oral dose of remikiren can induce a renal vasodilation, without affecting the GFR and despite a significant decrease in blood pressure. This systemic and renal hemodynamic response is more pronounced in case of a more activated renin-angiotensin system.",
