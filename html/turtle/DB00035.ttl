	<http://schema.org/description> "Desmopressin is a chemical that is similar to Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) which is found naturally in the body. It increases urine concentration and decreases urine production. Desmopressin is used to prevent and control excessive thirst, urination, and dehydration caused by injury, surgery, and certain medical conditions, allowing you to sleep through the night without awakening to urinate. It is also used to treat specific types of diabetes insipidus and conditions after head injury or pituitary surgery." ;

Desmpressin is a structural analogue of ADH modified by  deamination of 1-cysteine and substitution of 8-L-arginine by 8-D-arginine. Compared to natural ADH, desmopressin elicits a great antidiuretic response on weight basis." ;
