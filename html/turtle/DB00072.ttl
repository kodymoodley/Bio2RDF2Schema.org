HER2 protein overexpression is observed in 25%-30% of primary breast cancers.Trastuzumab has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumorcells that overexpress HER2. It is a mediator of antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity, in that the binding of the antibody to HER2 overexpressing cells leads to preferential cell death." ;
