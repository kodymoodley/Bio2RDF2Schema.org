	<http://schema.org/mechanismOfAction> "Hyaluronidase is a spreading or diffusing substance. It increase the permeability of connective tissue through the hydrolysis of hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronidase hydrolyzes hyaluronic acid by splitting the glucosaminidic bond between C1 of the glucosamine moiety and C4 of glucuronic acid. This temporarily decreases the viscosity of the cellular cement and increases diffusion of injected fluids or of localized transudates or exudates, thus facilitating their absorption." ;
