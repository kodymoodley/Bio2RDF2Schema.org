	<http://schema.org/clinicalPharmacology> "Used to treat female infertility, Menotropins stimulates late follicular maturation and resumption of oocyte meiosis, and initiates rupture of the pre-ovulatory ovarian follicle. Menotropins bind to the LH/hCG/FSH receptor of the granulosa and theca cells of the ovary to effect these changes in the absence of an endogenous LH surge." ;

The drug contains both FSH and LH,therefore, it induces ovarian follicular growth and development as well as gonadal steroid production in women who do not have ovarian failure.FSH is the primary driver of follicular recruitment and growth in early folliculogenesis, while LH is important for ovarian steroidogenesis and is involved in the physiological events leading to development of a competent pre-ovulatory follicle" ;
