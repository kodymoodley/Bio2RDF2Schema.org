	<http://schema.org/description> "Abciximab is a Fab fragment of the chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody 7E3. Abciximab binds to the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor of human platelets and inhibits platelet aggregation by preventing the binding of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and other adhesive molecules. It also binds to vitronectin (αvβ3) receptor found on platelets and vessel wall endothelial and smooth muscle cells." ;

	<http://schema.org/mechanismOfAction> "Abciximab binds to the intact platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor, which is a member of the integrin family of adhesion receptors and the major platelet surface receptor involved in platelet aggregation. This binding is thought to involve steric hindrance and/or conformational alterations which block access of large molecules to the receptor rather than direct interaction with the RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid) binding site of GPIIb/IIIa. By binding to the vitronectin receptor (also known as the αvβ3 integrin), abciximab blocks effects mediated by this integrin which include cell adhesion. Furthermore, abciximab blocks Mac-1 receptor on monocytes and neutrophils thus inhibiting monocyte adhesion." ;
