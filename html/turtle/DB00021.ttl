	<http://schema.org/description> "This drug is the synthetic form of natural secretin.  It is prepared using solid phase peptide synthesis.  Secretin is a peptide hormone produced in the S cells of the duodenum. Its main effect is to regulate the pH of the small  intestineâ€™s contents through the control of gastric acid secretion and buffering with bicarbonate. It was the first hormone to be discovered." ;

	<http://schema.org/clinicalPharmacology> "Used in the diagnosis of pancreatic dysfunction or gastrinoma (stomach cancer), secretin is a hormone produced in the S cells of the duodenum in response to low local pH. It stimulates the secretion of bicarbonate from bicarbonate producing organs(liver, pancreas, Brunner's glands) when the pH drops below a set value. This helps neutralize the gastric acid entering the duodenum from the stomach. It also inhibits acid secretion from the stomach by reducing gastrin release from the G cells of the stomach." ;
