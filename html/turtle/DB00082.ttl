	<http://schema.org/description> "Pegvisomant is a highly selective growth hormone (GH) receptor antagonist.  It is used to treat acromegaly.  Unlike dopamine or somatostatin analogs (which inhibit growth hormone secretion), this drug actually blocks the hepatic (GH-mediated) production of insulin like growth factor (IGF-1), which is the main mediator of growth hormone activity." ;
