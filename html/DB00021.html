  "clinicalPharmacology" : "Used in the diagnosis of pancreatic dysfunction or gastrinoma (stomach cancer), secretin is a hormone produced in the S cells of the duodenum in response to low local pH. It stimulates the secretion of bicarbonate from bicarbonate producing organs(liver, pancreas, Brunner's glands) when the pH drops below a set value. This helps neutralize the gastric acid entering the duodenum from the stomach. It also inhibits acid secretion from the stomach by reducing gastrin release from the G cells of the stomach.",

  "description" : "This drug is the synthetic form of natural secretin.  It is prepared using solid phase peptide synthesis.  Secretin is a peptide hormone produced in the S cells of the duodenum. Its main effect is to regulate the pH of the small  intestine’s contents through the control of gastric acid secretion and buffering with bicarbonate. It was the first hormone to be discovered.",
